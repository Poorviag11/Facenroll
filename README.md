# Facenroll
This project is aimed at detecting faces in real-time video streams and marking attendance in an Excel file stored on Google Drive. It utilizes Google Colab, Haar Cascade, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms for achieving the desired functionality.
# Features
•Real-Time Face Detection: For real-time face detection in video streams, Haar Cascade is used.

•Attendance Marking: In an Excel file saved on Google Drive, marks the presence of faces that are observed.


•Google Colab Integration: Developed and tested in Google Colab, providing an accessible and collaborative environment for development.


•CNN Algorithm: Incorporates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate face detection.

# Dependencies
•Google Colab: Cloud-based Python notebook environment provided by Google.

•Haar Cascade: Pre-trained XML classifiers for detecting objects, including faces.

•Google Drive: For accessing and modifying files stored on Google Drive.

•OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library for real-time computer vision.

# Setup Instructions
•Clone the repository to your local machine.

•Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

•Ensure you have a Google account and access to Google Drive.

•Set up a Google Colab notebook environment.

•Run the provided notebook files for face detection and attendance marking.

# Usage
• Connect the camera for face detection with Google colab by giving permissions.

• Upload the video stream or provide access to your webcam.

• Run the notebook cells to initiate face detection.

• Follow the prompts to mark attendance in the Excel file.
